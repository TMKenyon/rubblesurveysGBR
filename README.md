Benthic_Cover_Binding_Survey_Data contains data on benthic cover within the quadrats placed on rubble beds in each of the 16 sites.
A unique site is the site name, and the depth, e.g., Coral Gardens Shallow is one of the 16 unique sites.
The Intermediate exposure sites are not included in the analysis in the manuscript. However, Blue Pools is included in discussions as a comparison.
While coral composition was determined, only one coral category was used in the final analysis and manuscript.
Column A specifies location: Heron or Keppels
Column B specifies exposure: Exposed, Intermediate or Sheltered
Column C specifies site: noting at Heron that sites on the reef slope generally comprise two depths, e.g., Eco1 Shallow and Deep
Column D specifies depth: Shallow, Deep. Blue Pools is also shallow, but not included in analysis
Column E specifies quadrat number: This is not included in the benthic cover analyses in the manuscript because there are not multiple measurements per quadrat. However, quadrats were remeasured in 2023 and quadrat number will be used for that analysis.
Column F speciies year: Only 2021 was considered in this manuscript.
Column G species whether the quadrat was surveyed in both years.
Column H to X are the benthic cover categories, with percentage of the quadrat covered by each specified.

Binding_Survey_Data_v8 contains data on rubble bed and piece characteristics, taken from quadrats placed on rubble beds in each of the 16 sites.
Columns that are used in analyses are specified below. Other columns are redundant or superseded by other columns.
Column A speciies year: Only 2021 was considered in this manuscript.
Column B specifies location: Heron or Keppels
Column C specifies exposure: Exposed, Intermediate or Sheltered
Column D specifies depth: Shallow, Deep. Blue Pools is also shallow, but not included in analysis
Column E specifies site: noting at Heron that sites on the reef slope generally comprise two depths, e.g., Eco1 Shallow and Deep
Column F specifies site_unique, i.e., the combination of site and depth.
Column I is the date of survey
Column K specifies quadrat number: This is included in the binding/stability/rubble size etc. analyses in the manuscript because there are multiple measurements per quadrat.
Column Q is the quadrat angle.
Column T, U, V is patch width, length and area, in metres / metres cubed.
Column Y is average bed depth in cm, an average of the 8 bed depth measurements in columns Z to AG
Columns AH and AI are the piece numbers (number within quadrat and unique piece)
Column AO is the maximum gap size from sampled piece to closed piece on right (cm)
Column AR is the stability as binomial (either 0 not stable, or 1 stable) (Stable_0-1_v2)
Column AU describes why the rubble piece is stable (Stable_description2)
Column AW is the Widest_span_cm2 of each rubble piece - in cm.
Column AZ is the morphology of each sampled rubble piece (Morphology2)
Column BB is the number of branches for each sampled rubble piece (Num_branches2)
Column BF is the number of binds for each sampled rubble piece (Number_binds2)
Column BJ specified whether the sampled rubble piece is bound (1) or not (0) (Bound)
Columns BO up to DA specify the binder type and length for each bind (up to 15 per sampled rubble piece).
For these columns, the binder type is specified in the columns named Binder1-broad_cat, Binder2-broad_cat, Binder3-broad_cat and so on.
And the binder length is specified in the columns Binder1_length_cm, Binder2_length_cm, Binder3_length_cm and so on. Other columns are superseded.
